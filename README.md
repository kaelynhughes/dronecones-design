# Design Documentation

This is a place for us to centralize and share our design ideas so we can build off each others' design. Feel free to use this as much or as little as you'd like, and any organization you prefer is welcome!

# Organization 

This project's design is based on four different parts. The customer side who is there to purchase 
the product, the employee who delivers the product to the customer, the manager, who is in charge
of managing inventory and accounts, and then the backend AKA universal that all three will use. This includes
API calls, login/sign up, and general database information. Each folder holds its respected pieces to
the software.
