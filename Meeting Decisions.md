# Decisions

### 3 Logins or 1 Login: 1 Login, users can have multiple types (i.e. Droners can also
be customers, managers are all 3).

### Guest instances only have customer permissions.

### Guest orders are marked as such in the db.

### Managers should be able to ban employees as well as customers.

### Add buttons as needed following text description.

### Drone sub-pages will consist of an order history page with filters, 
and an Manage/Register drone page, where you can view details on your drones,
 delete or deactivate drones, and a button to open a dialog to create a new 
drone.

### Convert floats to int for money calculations.

### We're not allowing password resets, but we could add a support form.

### We will save Username and Password (not emails)

### Stock will be bought in the same units it is sold.  Purchase price will be 
per scope, for example.
